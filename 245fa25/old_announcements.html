<h5 class="w3-text-teal">Math Club</h5>
<p>
    Prof Geske here. 
    The <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"  href ="https://www.instagram.com/uscmathclub">Math Club</a> will have its first meeting this coming Mon Sep 8 from 5-6pm in the math tea room, KAP 410, and will continue to have regular weekly meetings at the same time and location.  
</p>
<p>The math club is a place to meet other undergraduates with a passion for math, where you can chat math, play math-y games, enjoy snacks, occasionally learn about topics from professors or grad students, and gain insight into summer options and long-term career paths. 
    The setting is informal and about having fun and building community. :)
</p>
<p>
If you have questions, please reach out to the math club at <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"  href ="mailto:scmath@usc.edu">scmath@usc.edu</a>.
You can also email me, since I am the faculty advisor for the math club.
</p>
<p>
    Lastly: I have been consolidating information about undergrad-focused math talks at the university <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"  href ="https://christiangeske.com/undergrad_focused_talks.html">here</a>. 
    The list of talks will expand as the semester continues.

<h5 class="w3-text-teal">Simulation 1 Posted</h5>
<p>
    Prof Geske here. Your first Matlab Simulation assignment has been posted on <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"  href ="https://www.gradescope.com">Gradescope</a> and is due in one week on Tu Sep 9 at 11:59pm.
    Matlab will not be taught in lecture or discussion, but rather the key ideas will be introduced in companions to each assignment. 
     
</p>
<ul>

        Please go <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"  href = "https://christiangeske.com/245fa25/matlab.html">here</a> for a series of 3 videos providing instructions on accessing Matlab, using the Simulation Companion, and submitting your Matlab code to Gradescope.
    </li>
    <li>
        You are welcome to stop by our <a href = "https://christiangeske.com/245fa25/main.html#officehours">office hours</a> if you need additional help.

<h5 class="w3-text-teal">Welcome!</h5>
<p>
Welcome! 
This is your Math 245 instructor Prof Geske!
I  would like you to kindly do the following prior to your first lecture.
<ul>
    <li>
        Access the <a href="https://christiangeske.com/245fa25/main.html">course webpage</a> and read through it.
        Almost all of the course content, including the syllabus, is found at this webpage.
        I will not discuss the syllabus in great detail during lecture, but will be happy to answer questions about it, so do read thorough it first.
    </li>
    <li>
        Verify that you do not have any conflicts with the assigned exam dates. 
        Email me immediately if you do!
    </li>
    <li>
        Only if you require testing accomodations: initiate your registration with <a href = "https://osas.usc.edu/" target = "blank" rel = "noopener">OSAS</a>. 
    </li>
    <li>
        Access the Lecture 1 handout in the <a href="https://christiangeske.com/245fa25/main.html#dailyschedule">Daily Schedule</a> on the course webpage.
        I will print a copy for you for the first lecture, however you may also prepare it on your own notetaking device. 
    </li>
    <li>
        Access <a href="https://brightspace.usc.edu/" target = "blank" rel = "noopener">Brightspace</a> and find our course page.
        Click the Gradescope tab and sign up.
        Gradescope is how you will submit your homework for grading.
        Besides this instance, we will use Brightspace very rarely.
    </li>
    <li>
        You should also have received an announcement on Brightspace detailing the Course ID and Course Key for our <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.myopenmath.com/index.php">MyOpenMath</a> course.
        Please sign up. 
        I <b>strongly</b> recommend completing the optional <b>Preparation for A1</b> assessment in the <b>Review</b> block as it will remind you of various techniques of integration, with which I will assume you are comfortable.
    </li>
</ul>
